# moz-gc-exeriments

Documentation etc for ongoing wasm gc experiments at Mozilla

[Version 2](version2.md) (in progress) adds the full reftypes proposal, including multiple tables and table manipulation instructions, to the MVA for GC types.  It is not quite backward compatible with version 1.

[Version 1](version1.md) (obsolete) is the "minimal viable alpha" (MVA) for GC types - the smallest system that is useful and safe, including a subset of the reftypes proposal.  As of November 26 2018, Firefox Nightly no longer recognizes Version 1.
